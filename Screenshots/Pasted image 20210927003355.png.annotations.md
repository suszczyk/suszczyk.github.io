I'm definitely not on the host machine now. ifconfig shows the IP 172.17.0.2:

The file system is quite empty.
Docker-Toolbox
At this point, a bit more detail about Docker-Toolbox is necessary. The solution is deprecated, but that
doesn't mean it can't be seen in the wild. Docker Toolbox installs VirtualBox, and creates a VM running
the boot2docker Linux distribution. From it's README:
Boot2Docker is a lightweight Linux distribution made specifically to run Docker containers. It runs
completely from RAM, is a ~45MB download and boots quickly.
At the bottom of that page, there's information on how to SSH into the VM using the username docker
and the password tcuser. I considered doing a ping sweep of the network to look for other hosts, but
ping isn't installed on this container.
